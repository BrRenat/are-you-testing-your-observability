We work for Red Hat.
We are building scalable Observability solutions and platforms for OpenShift.
We work with Prometheus and Thanos on a daily basis.

This is Kemal's first talk.
That's why we worked very hard... (sarcasm)

# Agenda

#### (TODO: REMOVE!)

---

## What is observability; Why Prometheus [5m-7m]
* Signals
* Metrics are essential.

#### (TODO: REMOVE!)

---

## Instrumenting Go applications; Common pitfalls
* Globals [5m]
* Expose HTTP
* Define metrics
* Register
* Collectors are your friends
* Problems: terrible for libs ???
* Solution: custom registered ???
* Counter vs Gauges: [2m]
* Problems:
* Queue size vs added/removed?
* Gauge, reset etc loss of info
* Histogram vs Summaries [2m]
* Yolo histogram buckets [4m]
* Not SLO based; flat
* USE/RED Methods ??
* Random string in labels; Cardinality [4m]
* No Testing [4m]
* Hardcoding namespace in libraries/package [2m]
* WrapRegisterer
* Not using middlewares [5m]
* Solution: Reuse internally

#### (TODO: REMOVE!)

---

## Summary [2m]

#### (TODO: REMOVE!)

---

## Extras

* Convention/reuse dashboards; mixins!
* Testing your alerts!
* Furthermore; logs, tracing...

#### (TODO: REMOVE!)
